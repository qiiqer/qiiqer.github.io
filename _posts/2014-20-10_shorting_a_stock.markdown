#Shorting

I had a hard time wrapping my head around what shorting a stock is, so here is an explanation.  

When an investor is long a stock, it means to buy a share at a low price with the expectation 
that the share price will go higher in the future. So to be long a stock, buy first and sell 
(or not) sell in the future. 

When an investor is short a stock, it means to sell *borrowed* shares from a lender now with the 
expectation to buy the shares at a lower price in the future.
