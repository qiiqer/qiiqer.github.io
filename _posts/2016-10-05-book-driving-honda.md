# [Driving Honda by Jeffrey Rothfeder] [1]

Don't just copy or imitate

Competition makes you better

## When you quit, I quit

> "Honda-san, I want you to know that I'll quit when you quit."
>
>  -- Takeo Fujisawa 

## Sangen Shugi,  Three Realities
- Gen-ba, real place
- Gen-butsu, real part
- Gen-jitsu, real facts

Don't piss on our dreams

## Three Ways
- Joy of creation
- Joy of selling
- Joy of buying


Least automated automaker

Humility, ask nicely

## Sigmoidal Curve, Charles Handy

Monozukuri, how you do things matter not just the end result.
